**To introduce myself...**

Hi ! My name is Lucia Rossignol, I am a first year MURP student from France and Italy, in the dual degree with Sciences Po, concentrating in Design & Development. I grew up in Paris, France, and I am a little bit lost in immense LA -I arrived here a month ago. 

**Project ideas**

I would like to work on environmental / biodiversity issues, as well as environmentally friendly means of transportation. I could be interested in working on ocean water quality in LA area beaches / waste collection & management / populations of urban wildlife / waterproofing of natural soils in urban areas / bike routes and determining to which populations they are more accessible to. 

**Goals for the class**

I would like to have basic Python skills &
I would like to be able to create clear maps by myself!
