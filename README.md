**To introduce myself quickly...**

Hi ! My name is Lucia Rossignol, I am a first year MURP student from France and Italy, in the dual degree with Sciences Po, concentrating in Design & Development. I grew up in Paris, France, and I am a little bit lost in immense LA -I arrived here a month ago. 

**Project ideas**

I would like to work on mapping environmental / biodiversity issues in the LA area. I could be interested in working on ocean water quality in LA area beaches / waste collection & management / locating populations of urban wildlife 

**Goals for the class**

I would like to have basic Python skills &
I would like to be able to create clear maps by myself!
